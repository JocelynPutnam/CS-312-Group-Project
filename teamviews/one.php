    <p> Hi! I'm Alison Sherwood, my pronouns are she/her, I'm a Junior studying business with a double 
        concentration in Human Resource Managment and Innovation Management
        along with a minor in Computer Science. I love spending time outdoors, reading
        and crocheting. I also love to travel! A fun fact about me is that I have a pet gecko named Dawson.</p>
